    <h2>Arguments</h2>
    <dl><dt>metanetwork</dt>
<dd><p>object of class metanetwork</p></dd>


<dt>g</dt>
<dd><p>network (igraph object) to represent, default is metaweb</p></dd>


<dt>beta</dt>
<dd><p>the diffusion parameter of the diffusion kernel, a positive scalar controlling the
vertical squeezing of the network</p></dd>


<dt>legend</dt>
<dd><p>resolution for the legend, legend resolution must be a coarser resolution than the resolution of g, default is NULL</p></dd>


<dt>mode</dt>
<dd><p>mode used for layout, 'TL-tsne' for trophic level t-sne. Default is 'TL-tsne'</p></dd>


<dt>edge_thrs</dt>
<dd><p>if non-null, a numeric (between 0 and 1) indicating an edge threshold for the representation</p></dd>


<dt>layout_metaweb</dt>
<dd><p>a boolean indicating whether the layout of the metaweb should be used to represent the network
to use metaweb layout = T, you need first to compute metaweb layout for this beta value using <code><a href="attach_layout.html">attach_layout()</a></code></p></dd>


<dt>nrep_ly</dt>
<dd><p>If several layouts for this beta value are attached to the metaweb (if <code>layout_metaweb = T</code>), index of the layout to use, see <code><a href="attach_layout.html">attach_layout()</a></code></p></dd>


<dt>flip_coords</dt>
<dd><p>a boolean indicating whether coordinates should be flipped.
In that case, y-axis is the trophic level and x-axis is the layout axis</p></dd>


<dt>diff_plot_bool</dt>
<dd><p>boolean, do not edit by hand</p></dd>


<dt>x_y_range</dt>
<dd><p>a two dimension numeric vector, indicating dilatation of x,y axis</p></dd>


<dt>visNetwork.config</dt>
<dd><p>configuration list for visNetwork representation, default is visNetwork.default</p></dd>


<dt>TL_tsne.config</dt>
<dd><p>configuration list for mode 'TL-tsne', default is TL_tsne.default</p></dd>
